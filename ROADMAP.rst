flatten-tool Roadmap
====================

Plan for August - December 2016
-------------------------------

We will:
- Fix a bunch of bugs (particularly those discovered as OCDS flatten-tool gets more usage) 
- Change how we shorten spreadsheet titles 
- Add extra error information to improve display in Cove 

Weâ€™d like to (but are unlikely to have time for in the next 3 months):
- Fix OCDS titles support (requires flatten-tool and schema changes) 
- Add support for rows besides the first containing header information 
- Reduce memory usage 
- ODS support 
- Review tests 
- Spend some more time cleaning up the code 

May - July what we did
----------------------

- Source maps 
- Changed parameters and defaults to be more consistent 
- Warnings for duplicate column headers 
- Many bug fixes 
- Wrote lots of documentation and OCDS blog post
